# Instagram-unfollower
Tired of losers on Instagram who unfollow you, but keep you as a follower? This script will fix that by automatically unfollowing such Instagram accounts for you. Let it run in the background while you do anything else. You are also able to whitelist accounts that don't follow you but you may want to keep following, i.e. celebrities.

Notes:
- The nature of the script is that it simulates a human user controlling a browser. There is no quick way of retrieving accoutn data due to the lack of relevant Instagram APIs. Thus, how long the script takes to complete will be influenced by factors like Internet speed and how many accounts you are following
- Script requires Mozilla Firefox to be downloaded. Feel free to uninstall Firefox if you no longer intend to use script
- Each time the script is run, it opens and uses a new browser. Feel free to close any browser once the script is done
- Using a separate browser on fullscreen may pause the script
- Having the script-controlled browser in view is not necessary for the script to run
- Interacting with the script-controlled browser may cause problems with the script
- During the script, Instagram may alert you that an "unrecognized device" logged onto your account. Do not be alarmed, as it is just your own device
- There is a chance that Instagram may detect bot activity and thus ask for text or email verification. In this case, simply proceed with verification and rerun the script afterward
