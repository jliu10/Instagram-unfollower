# Instagram-unfollower
Tired of losers on Instagram who unfollow you, but keep you as a follower? This script will fix that by automatically unfollowing such Instagram accounts for you. You are also able to whitelist accounts that don't follow you but you may want to keep following, i.e. celebrities.

Notes:
- Script requires Mozilla Firefox to be downloaded. Feel free to uninstall Firefox if you no longer intend to use script
- Using a separate browser on fullscreen may pause the script
- Having the script-controlled browser in view is not necessary for the script to run
- Interacting with the script-controlled browser may cause problems
